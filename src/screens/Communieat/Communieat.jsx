              Existing food delivery systems, such as subscription-based
              services like HelloFresh, often limit users in terms of choices,
              affordability, and community connection. They don&#39;t
              necessarily cater to impromptu cravings or the longing for a
              home-cooked meal. Communieat emerged as an innovative solution,
              offering an on-demand ordering service that bridges this gap by
              creating a platform for local culinary enthusiasts and enabling
              users to explore a diverse array of recipes tailored to their
              current desires. I collaborated with four other students from
              UMICH ArtEngine Organization, who shared an interest in this
              concept. With our varied fields of expertise, we formed a dynamic
              team, working synergistically to develop this app and proudly
              participating it at the CHI 2023 Student Design Challenge.

              Scenario Sample - “tight Spender” Jacob
            </p>
            <p className="jacob-is-a-years">
              Jacob is a 23 years old post-graduate student living in New York
              City. He works an entry level 9am-5pm job as an Advertising
              Analyst. Since he is so busy all the time, he does not have a lot
              of time to cook. However, he doesn&#39;t like spending a lot of
              money as he is on his own for the first time and is trying to
              budget appropriately. Jacob comes home from work and is extremely
              hungry for dinner. He is craving a hearty meal of salmon and
              vegetables, but does not have a lot of groceries on hand and quite
              frankly is too tired to even cook. Jacob decides to go online to
              assess his options. As someone who is price-conscious, Jacob
              compares the prices on various delivery apps. He also looks at
              pickup options. To his surprise, DoorDash has a promotion for free
              delivery! Jacob lives in the city, so has a hard time justifying
              getting food delivered due to the extra fees. However, with this
              promotion, the fees are eliminated and so, Jacob proceeds with his
              order. While on the app, he has a difficult time filtering through
              all of the restaurants. He wishes that he could just type in
              exactly what he is craving and have his desires met. Additionally,
              he misses his home and craves a healthy, home-cooked meal instead
              of a restaurant&#39;s menu. He makes do with what he has, though,
              and proceeds with his order. His food arrives quickly and he is
              pleasantly surprised that the delivery did not forget silverware!
              Overall, his experience today went well, but he knows that this is
              a rarity since his experience is contingent on price and timing.

          <p className="text-wrapper-156">
            After developing the personas, we moved on to creating scenarios.
            These scenarios were crafted to simulate real-life situations that
            our personas might encounter. It was essential for understanding the
            context in which users would be interacting with our app. We faced
            challenges in making the scenarios realistic and relatable, but
            through group discussions and gaining insights from the personas we
            overcame these hurdles.

              cooperatively simplified it to ensure a more intuitive experience.

              The next step was creating wireframes to establish the structure
              of the app. One issue we encountered was the difficulty of
              designing an app that caters to both cooks and consumers. The
              challenge was how to combine these two functions efficiently.
              After much discussion and weighing the pros and cons, the team
              decided to divide each function into individual apps – one for
              food providers and one for food consumers. Since users of each app
              are clearly divided, and it is not intuitive to have two functions
              on one unified app. To ensure that users could switch between the
              two functionalities with ease, we provided a link on the user page
              of each app on the profile page that would allow users to switch
              to the other app.

                  Before conducting the tests, a test plan was created. This
                  involved listing the tasks that participants would perform and

                  Efforts were made to create a natural testing environment that

                  Task Execution and Answer Collection: Participants were asked

                  wireframes. Their responses and actions were collected for
                  analysis.

                Developing the high-fidelity wireframe was challenging due to
                the attention to detail required. Ensuring consistency in design
                elements like colors, fonts, and buttons throughout the app was
                an issue. We created a style guide that was strictly adhered to
                by all members.

                more feedback was collected and analyzed. One major discovery is
                that users wanted a feature to directly communicate with the
                cooks. The team discussed and decided to add a chat function to
                enhance the community aspect of the app.

              To enhance Communieat, it’s essential to expand user testing with
              diverse home chefs and consumers. Integrating social features such
              as ratings and a community forum can improve engagement.
              Implementing an AI-driven system for personalized meal
              recommendations based on user preferences is advisable.
              <br />
              Encouraging sustainability by urging home chefs to use locally
              sourced ingredients and recyclable packaging is also key. The app
              should be accessible to individuals with disabilities by adhering
              to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
              <br />
              Marketing strategies and partnerships with local suppliers or
              non-profits are needed for broader reach. Establishing a feedback
              system for continuous improvements is crucial.
              <br />
              By adopting these recommendations, Communieat can become a
              community-centric platform that promotes healthy eating and
              sustainability.

            This project was a collaborative effort by a dedicated team of five
            individuals. Through an extensive design process that involved
            empathizing with the users, creating scenarios, rigorous testing,
            and continuous iterations, Communieat was developed. This app is not
            just about delivering food; it&#39;s about fostering community
            connections and ensuring access to healthy, home-cooked meals.
            Through our concerted efforts, we overcame numerous challenges to
            create a product that we believe can make a difference in the way
            people experience food delivery.
