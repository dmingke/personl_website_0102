          <p className="existing-food">
            Existing food delivery systems, such as subscription-based services like HelloFresh, often limit users in
            terms of choices, affordability, and community connection. They don&#39;t necessarily cater to impromptu
            cravings or the longing for a home-cooked meal. Communieat emerged as an innovative solution, offering an
            on-demand ordering service that bridges this gap by creating a platform for local culinary enthusiasts and
            enabling users to explore a diverse array of recipes tailored to their current desires. I collaborated
            with four other students from UMICH ArtEngine Organization, who shared an interest in this concept. With
            our varied fields of expertise, we formed a dynamic team, working synergistically to develop this app and
            proudly participating it at the CHI 2023 Student Design Challenge.

              Connecting Cooks and Consumers: Communieat serves as a platform where cooks, especially those who do not
              have the means to establish a restaurant, can offer their home-cooked meals.
              <br />
              Personalized Recommendations: The app offers personalized meal recommendations and allows users to make
              individualized recipe requests based on their cravings at any given moment.
              <br />
              Flexible Delivery/Pickup Options: Communieat ensures a seamless delivery experience through partnerships
              with delivery drivers and also provides an option for pickup.
              <br />
              Price-sensitive Options: Catering to budget-conscious consumers, Communieat incorporates price-sensitive
              options and promotions to make healthy eating more accessible.

              Job As An Advertising Analyst. Since He Is So Busy All The Time, He Does Not Have A Lot Of Time To Cook.
              However, He Doesn&#39;t Like Spending A Lot Of Money As He Is On His Own For The First Time And Is
              Trying To Budget Appropriately. Jacob Comes Home From Work And Is Extremely Hungry For Dinner. He Is
              Craving A Hearty Meal Of Salmon And Vegetables, But Does Not Have A Lot Of Groceries On Hand And Quite
              Frankly Is Too Tired To Even Cook. Jacob Decides To Go Online To Assess His Options. As Someone Who Is
              Price-conscious, Jacob Compares The Prices On Various Delivery Apps. He Also Looks At Pickup Options. To
              His Surprise, Doordash Has A Promotion For Free Delivery! Jacob Lives In The City, So Has A Hard Time
              Justifying Getting Food Delivered Due To The Extra Fees. However, With This Promotion, The Fees Are
              Eliminated And So, Jacob Proceeds With His Order. While On The App, He Has A Difficult Time Filtering
              Through All Of The Restaurants. He Wishes That He Could Just Type In Exactly What He Is Craving And Have
              His Desires Met. Additionally, He Misses His Home And Craves A Healthy, Home-cooked Meal Instead Of A
              Restaurant&#39;s Menu. He Makes Do With What He Has, Though, And Proceeds With His Order. His Food
              Arrives Quickly And He Is Pleasantly Surprised That The Delivery Did Not Forget Silverware! Overall, His
              Experience Today Went Well, But He Knows That This Is A Rarity Since His Experience Is Contingent On
              Price And Timing.

            After developing the personas, we moved on to creating scenarios. These scenarios were crafted to simulate
            real-life situations that our personas might encounter. It was essential for understanding the context in
            which users would be interacting with our app. We faced challenges in making the scenarios realistic and
            relatable, but through group discussions and gaining insights from the personas we overcame these hurdles.

                  The next step was creating wireframes to establish the structure of the app. One issue we
                  encountered was the difficulty of designing an app that caters to both cooks and consumers. The
                  challenge was how to combine these two functions efficiently. After much discussion and weighing the
                  pros and cons, the team decided to divide each function into individual apps – one for food
                  providers and one for food consumers. Since users of each app are clearly divided, and it is not
                  intuitive to have two functions on one unified app. To ensure that users could switch between the
                  two functionalities with ease, we provided a link on the user page of each app on the profile page
                  that would allow users to switch to the other app.

                  users of the two apps, those who often order ready food online and those who like to cook
                  themselves. Before running the testing, we prepared the test plans including listing tasks and
                  writing scripts. We tried to set the test environment in a natural way to mimic the real usage case.
                  After users provided their answers to tasks, we asked them to explain their answers to test their
                  comprehension when needed as well as ask follow-up questions. <br />

              To enhance Communieat, it’s essential to expand user testing with diverse home chefs and consumers.
              Integrating social features such as ratings and a community forum can improve engagement. Implementing
              an AI-driven system for personalized meal recommendations based on user preferences is advisable.
              <br />
              Encouraging sustainability by urging home chefs to use locally sourced ingredients and recyclable
              packaging is also key. The app should be accessible to individuals with disabilities by adhering to Web
              Content Accessibility Guidelines.
              <br />
              Marketing strategies and partnerships with local suppliers or non-profits are needed for broader reach.
              Establishing a feedback system for continuous improvements is crucial.
              <br />
              By adopting these recommendations, Communieat can become a community-centric platform that promotes
              healthy eating and sustainability.
