          After a period of working with the project supervisor Ima, I gradually participated in two more projects,
          which I help progressing the cognitive psychological research project, ACM SIGCSE 2023: Reducing
          procrastination without sacrificing studentsâ€™ autonomy through optional weekly presentations of
          student-generated content, by conducting and monitoring research sessions remotely, suggesting ideas to
          improve the design of procedures and interpretations of research results, and analyzing research data by using
          R and SPSS, and facilitating computer science team to make nodes of computer science knowledge in deep
          learning and code 1Cademy front-end by using python to write flask applications.

          Running heuristic evaluation on 1cademy.com with 5 other members from the UX research group. We carefully
          evaluate the 5 severity levels (from 0, the least severe, to 4, the most severe) of 10 heuristic evaluation
          principles. I made this table for group members to fill up using Figma. 6 members all presented severe issues
          they found out and discussed which problems need to fix first by choosing the one we all agree upon. After
          that, I and another UX research member first made a very low-fidelity prototype for explaining why this is a
          usability issue and demonstrating our solution proposal and then met with the UI team via Zoom to discuss the
          viability of this solution and what to do next.

            Creating personas for 1Cademy potential users to empathize with users and facilitate the developer teams and
            the UI team to gain a deeper understanding of users&#39; behavior and needs. When discussing user needs we
            would refer to Paul Doe and Sarah Johns as our main users and converse more effectively and focused since we
            all know who and what characters we were talking about in the meetings. I recommended during UX and UI
            collaborating meetings to create personas because when we brainstorm, there were no specific user images for
            us to focus on their needs. Everyone uses themselves or people they know as users and talks about their
            potential needs. These two fictitious characters prevent this from happening. For creating these two
            personas, we used the demographic information of our past research participants provided in their experiment
            sessions of cognitive psychological research projects as they were all people who are users of the website{" "}

          As a member of 1Cademy,&nbsp;&nbsp;at first, I focused on UX research and UI design. I collaborated with the
          UX research team and UI design team to develop 1Cademy multiple websites (experimental site to perform remote
          research sessions, 1cademy.com AKA 1cademy main page for presenting all key information of 1Cademy, and
          1Cademy notebooks for learning and adding knowledge nodes) on Figma and improve their usability and
          accessibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;We divided a part of the jobs to each person and make suggestions for each otherâ€™s
          design in the weekly meeting. <br />
          Later on, after gradually perfecting PC view, I also helped to design a low-fidelity prototype of the mobile
          view of the website and perform UX research methods, mainly heuristic evaluations, competitive analysis,
          usability testing, and surveys with other team members. Therefore, the whole process contained a lot of
          teamwork and communication.

This design was further discussed with the UX research team and supervisors for modifications."

          After more than one year volunteering at 1Cademy, I had took part in computer science, UX research, cognitive
          psychology research, and UI design teams. Therefore, when it comes to handover the modifications and new
          tasks, I commonly worked as a coordinator between three teams when meetings required all three groupsâ€™
          participation. I generally explained how would the new design works to the developing team due to my computer
          science knowledge and how a change was required for the UI design team due to my UX knowledge.
