                      As a member of 1Cademy,&nbsp;&nbsp;at first, I focused on UX research and UI design. I
                      collaborated with the UX research team and UI design team to develop 1Cademy multiple websites
                      (experimental site to perform remote experiment sessions, 1cademy.com AKA 1cademy main page for
                      presenting all key information of 1Cademy, and 1Cademy notebooks for learning and adding knowledge
                      nodes) on Figma and improve their usability and accessibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;We divided a part of the
                      jobs to each person and make suggestions for each otherâ€™s design in the weekly meeting. <br />
                      Later on, after gradually perfecting PC view, I also helped to design a low-fidelity prototype of
                      the mobile view of the website and perform UX research methods, mainly heuristic evaluations,
                      competitive analysis, usability testing, and surveys with other team members. Therefore, the whole
                      process contained a lot of teamwork and communication.

                      comes to connecting three groups for requested modifications and new development tasks, I commonly
                      worked as a coordinator between three teams to explain how would the new design works to the
                      developing team using my knowledge of computer science and why a change is necessary for the UI
                      design team using my UX knowledge.

            <p className="text-wrapper-12">
              Following the design guide of 1Cademy, I designed the first version of the navigation bar based on the
              instructions from my team leader and project supervisor Iman. We argued about each component of the
              navigation bar in the meeting before starting the design. After finishing the first draft of the basic
              layout, it took another iteration of meetings, getting opinions from UX/UI teamsâ€™ members, and revising. I
              made four variants, login (a registered user), logout (no account), and researcher (after application),
              without a search bar for demonstration. The final decision about what the navigation bar should look like
              was deliberated later in the meeting. The current navigation bar on 1cademy.com was the third version
              designed by another teammate based on my version.

                Before making the high-fidelity prototype of the search page, we first worked on the low-fidelity
                wireframe during and after the meeting, which took three iterations to brainstorm, suggest, and revise.
                Each component required an amount of consideration on usability, aesthetics, accessibility, and
                information hierarchy. We started it by gathering what should be put and graphing the information
                hierarchy, and then based on the information hierarchy to decide where each element should be. With the
                final decisions and design requirements, we wireframed the webpage on{" "}

                carefully evaluate the 5 severity levels (from 0, the least severe, to 4, the most severe) of 10
                heuristic evaluation principles. I made this table for group members to fill up using Figma. 6 members
                all presented severe issues they found out and discussed which problems need to fix first by choosing
                the one we all agree upon. After that, I and another UX research member first made a very low-fidelity
                prototype for explaining why this is a usability issue and demonstrating our solution proposal and then
                met with the UI team via Zoom to discuss the viability of this solution and what to do next.

                Creating personas for 1Cademy potential users to empathize with users and facilitate the developer teams
                and the UI team to gain a deeper understanding of users&#39; behavior and needs. When discussing user
                needs we would refer to Paul Doe and Sarah Johns as our main users and converse more effectively and
                focused since we all know who and what characters we were talking about in the meetings. I recommended
                during UX and UI collaborating meetings to create personas because when we brainstorm, there were no
                specific user images for us to focus on their needs. Everyone uses themselves or people they know as
                users and talks about their potential needs. These two fictitious characters prevent this from
                happening. For creating these two personas, we used the demographic information of our past research
                participants provided in their experiment sessions of cognitive psychological research projects as they
                were all people who are users of the website{" "}

              By participating in a cognitive psychological research project regarding the topic of Improving

              proceeding experiment sessions on a daily basis, monitoring and guiding participants to complete their
              experiments, answering their questions, taking notes of their reading sequences for analysis. Before all
              experiments started, we created one experiment script for other research assistants to ensure consistent
              procedures and reduce potential variables. We also discussed experiment design in many meetings and spent
              much time limiting independent variables and selecting the ACT articles that fit our requirements. All
              selections and designs require support from published scientific journals, so we read dozens of journals
              before presenting an idea or a change.

              I volunteered at 1Cademy for a very long period and spent most of my extracurricular time helping,
              developing, and learning in this community. I have participated in more than three research projects and
              contributed many improving ideas. Through tasks assigned, I learned many things from team leaders and
              other members and gained tons of experience, including communication skills, knowledge in UX/UI design,
              deep learning, and other computer science fields, experience with Figma, cognitive psychology, knowledge
              visualization, interpersonal skills, public speaking, and much more. This community gave me the
              opportunity to apply my interdisciplinary knowledge and learn more from real projects. Every opinion and
              suggestion from other researchers during meetings or collaborations was helpful for me to grow my skills.
              Working in such a multidisciplinary, inclusive, and diverse group, I kept being impressed and taught by othersâ€™ novel
              and creative ideas which I have never thought of.
