                  The research focused on the student&#39;s specific travel needs to analyze and redesign Expedia&#39;s
                  website to better tailor it for future students’ travel needs. Interviews and surveys were used to
                  gather qualitative and quantitative data concerning students&#39; travel needs, and the participants
                  were all college students from Michigan. <br />

                  Upon conversation with my friend about our plan to travel to Miami, we like to use Expedia to see the
                  hotel and flight information. However, we found that there is always a pain to plan a long trip, like
                  where to stay and what to visit since we need to browse tons of information online and jump from one
                  site to another to make a decision. We start to wonder if having to use tons of apps to plan a trip
                  was only my main frustration with using online travel platforms and what their primary needs are when
                  they travel. Knowing that we want to try redesigning Expedia to generate a better user experience for
                  students (aged 18-25). All team members are from the UX education student organization, a newly
                  founded student institution. I invited them to carry out this UX research project as an organizational
                  activity.

                Our research team conducted a survey to gain further insights into the travel needs of college students.
                We had previously conducted interviews, and the survey was designed to validate our assumptions and
                gather additional evidence. We selected 100 college students from Michigan, California, Texas, and New
                York, representing different regions of America, to explore whether students&#39; geographic location
                impacts their travel choices. The survey consisted of 20 questions and were focused on confirming our
                interview conclusions while&nbsp;&nbsp;uncovering factors influencing participants&#39; activity and
                destination preferences during their travels. To ensure that our survey was not biased or influenced by
                the behavior of our respondents, we piloted the first versions to beta-test our questions. <br />

                interpersonal relationships, engagement in fun and outdoor activities, preference for beach
                destinations, and the significance of time efficiency. By analyzing the responses of the 100 college
                students from different states, we were able to draw meaningful conclusions about the factors
                influencing their travel choices.

              Extracting useful information from interviews and surveys for web redesign is not as easy as we might have
              thought. Further application of these findings into design also required time and effort to discuss and
              brainstorm ideas. From this research, I realized that asking non-leading and descriptive questions in
              interviews and surveys determines whether or not non-directive answers are obtained from participants.
              Preventing assumptions from being made is critical to UX research. Since everyone has experience using a
              website/app, our personal experience can greatly influence the conclusions drawn from the data. In order
              to prevent it from happening, it is very useful for me to repeatedly reflect on whether I make assumptions
              ahead of time.

            <p className="for-current-expedia">
              For current Expedia.com, based on the data we gathered, I proposed a few recommendations： <br />
              when booking flights or stays, platforms can first ask about the purpose of travel, vacation, or business;
              if travel for vacation, stays, flights, car rents, and attractions are recommended to be booked at once as
              a big travel package. One option is that Expedia.com can collaborate with Yelp.com to make bookings
              (Yelp.com was mentioned as one of the most frequent sites to make travel plans). Attraction tickets can
              also be booked in this comprehensive package. Moreover, the most frequently booked package can be
              recommended to users and enable them to make adjustments to this package. The site currently separates
              booking flights or stays. Based on the data, I would suggest making it a shopping cart in which they can
              add all products (e.g., flights, hotels, attractions tickets, or reservations), book and make payment all
              at once with less effort required.
              <br />
              After making a purchase, all trip details should be layouts chronologically, and viewed the main details
              (e.g., time, locations including the link directing to map apps, special notices/requirements) easily.
              <br />
              the app can provide a tool to compare costs between different travel plans when users add or remove an
              item like flight reservations.
              <br />
              In this way, users can save effort to compare costs and values and make reservations site-by-site by
              booking everything at one site or directly leading to the site, then finishing the bookings.
              <br />
              Lastly, the final design can be complicated. Collaboration with my teammate and further research on the
              low-fidelity design version, such an iteration, are necessary.

            <p className="based-off-of-the">
              Based off of the data we gathered, we began to fabricate user personas to understand the different types
              of people concerned by focusing on two main themes from affinity map and survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Madison Jones
              is the personas for primary users for the Expedia student website.
            </p>
            <p className="text-wrapper-184">
              To further empathize and visualize the primary user, I created a journey map of Madison Jones’s a specific
              travel experience for a more concrete image of our main user.

              We began our journey by interviewing Michigan college students to gain insight into students’ frustrations
              from planning a trip to the end of it and the step-by-step planning process. We needed to see if there was
              a general frustration and an indication of improvement to Expedia. After finishing coding responses from
              our 10 interviewees in 15-minutes interviews each, we conducted an affinity diagramming to analyze our
              qualitative data.
