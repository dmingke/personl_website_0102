                  The research focused on the student&#39;s specific travel needs to analyze and redesign Expedia&#39;s
                  website to better tailor it for future students’ travel needs. Interviews and surveys were used to
                  gather qualitative and quantitative data concerning students&#39; travel needs, and the participants
                  were all college students from Michigan. <br />

                  Upon conversation with my friend about our plan to travel to Miami, we like to use Expedia to see the
                  hotel and flight information. However, we found that there is always a pain to plan a long trip, like
                  where to stay and what to visit since we need to browse tons of information online and jump from one
                  site to another to make a decision. We start to wonder if having to use tons of apps to plan a trip
                  was only my main frustration with using online travel platforms and what their primary needs are when
                  they travel. Knowing that we want to try redesigning Expedia to generate a better user experience for
                  students (aged 18-25). All team members are from the UX education student organization, a newly
                  founded student institution. I invited them to carry out this UX research project as an organizational
                  activity.

            <p className="for-current-expedia">
              For current Expedia.com, based on the data we gathered, I proposed a few recommendations： <br />
              when booking flights or stays, platforms can first ask about the purpose of travel, vacation, or business;
              if travel for vacation, stays, flights, car rents, and attractions are recommended to be booked at once as
              a big travel package. One option is that Expedia.com can collaborate with Yelp.com to make bookings
              (Yelp.com was mentioned as one of the most frequent sites to make travel plans). Attraction tickets can
              also be booked in this comprehensive package. Moreover, the most frequently booked package can be
              recommended to users and enable them to make adjustments to this package. The site currently separates
              booking flights or stays. Based on the data, I would suggest making it a shopping cart in which they can
              add all products (e.g., flights, hotels, attractions tickets, or reservations), book and make payment all
              at once with less effort required.
              <br />
              After making a purchase, all trip details should be layouts chronologically, and viewed the main details
              (e.g., time, locations including the link directing to map apps, special notices/requirements) easily.
              <br />
              the app can provide a tool to compare costs between different travel plans when users add or remove an
              item like flight reservations.
              <br />
              In this way, users can save effort to compare costs and values and make reservations site-by-site by
              booking everything at one site or directly leading to the site, then finishing the bookings.
              <br />
              Lastly, the final design can be complicated. Collaboration with my teammate and further research on the
              low-fidelity design version, such an iteration, are necessary.

            <p className="text-wrapper-60">
              Extracting useful information from interviews and surveys for web redesign is not as easy as we might have
              thought. Further application of these findings into design also required time and effort to discuss and
              brainstorm ideas. From this research, I realized that asking non-leading and descriptive questions in
              interviews and surveys determines whether or not non-directive answers are obtained from participants.
              Preventing assumptions from being made is critical to UX research. Since everyone has experience using a
              website/app, our personal experience can greatly influence the conclusions drawn from the data. In order
              to prevent it from happening, it is very useful for me to repeatedly reflect on whether I make assumptions
              ahead of time.

              We began our journey by interviewing Michigan college students to gain insight into students’ frustrations
              from planning a trip to the end of it and the step-by-step planning process. We needed to see if there was
              a general frustration and an indication of improvement to Expedia. After finishing coding responses from
              our 10 interviewees in 15-minutes interviews each, we conducted an affinity diagramming to analyze our
              qualitative data.

                    Our research team conducted a survey to gain further insights into the travel needs of college
                    students. We had previously conducted interviews, and the survey was designed to validate our
                    assumptions and gather additional evidence. We selected 100 college students from Michigan,
                    California, Texas, and New York, representing different regions of America, to explore whether
                    students&#39; geographic location impacts their travel choices. The survey consisted of 20 questions
                    and were focused on confirming our interview conclusions while&nbsp;&nbsp;uncovering factors
                    influencing participants&#39; activity and destination preferences during their travels. To ensure
                    that our survey was not biased or influenced by the behavior of our respondents, we piloted the
                    first versions to beta-test our questions. <br />

                    The survey provided our team with valuable quantitative and qualitative data, shedding light on
                    several key themes regarding students&#39; travel needs. These themes included the importance of
                    cost, interpersonal relationships, engagement in fun and outdoor activities, preference for beach
                    destinations, and the significance of time efficiency. By analyzing the responses of the 100 college
                    students from different states, we were able to draw meaningful conclusions about the factors
                    influencing their travel choices.

                  To further empathize and visualize the primary user, I created a journey map of Madison Jones’ travel
                  experience based on our scenario for understanding and addressing customer needs and pain points. In
                  this experience, Madison struggled with unpredictable flight delay issues. She did not use Expedia
                  because we want to analyze how could we redesign the website to help this common situation. This
                  narrative visualization helped us to have a more concrete idea of users&#39; images and needs when
                  brainstorming. Other members of the team created 2 more journey maps, one used Expedia with a bad
                  ending and one used Expedia with a happy ending, and one experience map to understand generic human
                  traveling behaviors based on data from surveys and interviews.
