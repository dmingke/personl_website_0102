                        In an era where online social networking is integral to daily life, and selfies serve as a
                        prevalent mode of self-expression, the necessity to examine the nexus between self-esteem, body
                        image, and selfie-taking behaviors cannot be overstated. This study endeavors to elucidate the
                        correlations between engagement in selfie-related activities and facets of self-perception,
                        namely self-esteem and body image. A sample of 103 females, ranging from 18 to 50 years of age,
                        was sourced from MTurk for this survey-based investigation.

                        selfies, and were gauged via two distinct self-report queries concerning the frequency of
                        sharing and editing selfies. Concurrently, self-esteem and body satisfaction were assessed
                        through a 20-item scale gauging participants’ concurrence with a series of statements. A Pearson
                        correlation coefficient was employed to analyze the statistical associations.

                        the frequency of selfie-posting was exclusively correlated with body satisfaction, without a

                Analyzing Plant Endemism in the Galápagos Islands and Livestock Mortality in East Africa Using R

              <div className="text-wrapper-47">Experience With Statistical Modeling</div>
              <p className="in-this-analytical">
                In this analytical project, I employed statistical modeling in R to delve into two distinct ecological
                datasets – one on plant endemism in the Galápagos Islands, and the other on livestock mortality in East
                Africa.
                <br />
                Galápagos Islands Plant Endemism:
                <br />
                Objective: To examine the factors affecting the proportion of endemic plant species on different islands
                in the Galápagos, focusing on island size, average elevation, and the proximity and size of neighboring
                islands.
                <br />
                Methodology:
                <br />I built multiple statistical models to test hypotheses related to island size, elevation, and
                neighborhood characteristics.
                <br />I simulated data based on the specified models and visualized the simulated data in R.
                <br />I specified likelihood functions for the models.
                <br />
                Validated the code by recovering known parameters from the simulated data.
                <br />I fitted models to the actual data and compared them using information criteria.
                <br />
                Lastly, interpreted the coefficients and evaluated the hypotheses.
                <br />
                East African Livestock Mortality:
                <br />
                Objective: To test the hypothesis that East African herders keep small stock as insurance against risk
                and to analyze livestock mortality as a function of stock type.
                <br />
                Methodology:
                <br />
                Using binomial regression, I modeled the counts in ‘mortality’ as a function of the categorical variable
                ‘stock’.
                <br />I compared models with and without predictor variables.
                <br />I visualized the proportion of dead animals in each dataset.
                <br />I then employed a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to predict ‘mortality’ with varying
                intercepts clustered by herd.
                <br />I interpreted the output of the fixed and random effects and compared GLM with GLMM.
                <br />
                Skills Showcased:
                <br />

                Model validation and comparison
                <br />
                Interpretation of statistical output
                <br />
                Through robust methodology, I analyzed ecological data to glean insights on plant endemism in the Galápagos Islands and
                livestock mortality in East Africa, showcasing my skills in data analysis and R programming.
