          The project is the second project of SI 422 Usability Needs and Evaluation, one undergraduate course from the
          school of information of the University of Michigan. Our main research focus is on the student&#39;s special
          travel needs in order to design an Expedia student travel website in the future. The research methods we used
          for gathering data about students&#39; travel needs are interviews and surveys, and the participants are all
          college students from Michigan.

          We First Interviewed Ten Participants Each For 10 More Minutes And Coded Their Answers By Well-marked Themes
          Related To Their Travel Needs. After Getting Themes, We Used Affinity Diagramming To Further Gather And
          Analyze These Themes.
          <br />
          several Main Themes Of Participants&#39; Travel Needs Are

            After gathering the interview data and having an insight into student travel needs, we validated our
            assumption and interview data using the survey. 20 questions were asked and mostly related to the factors
            that affect the decision of which activities participants choose to do and where they choose to go during
            the travel.

            As a quantitative research method, surveys provided our team with plenty of information that shows several

            importance of cost,

          And Interview Need To Be Re-organized And Prioritized To See Which One Is The Most Significant One To Their
          Travel Decisions. There Are Many Users Groups, So It Is Also Very Important To Choose The Primary, Secondary,

          Persona. In The Next Steps, We Would Determine The Primary (madison Jones May Be The Personas For Primary
          Users), Secondary, And Tertiary Users For The Expedia Student Website After Deciding On The Primary Focus Of
          The Website, Then Developing Several Personas Targeting Users With Other Travel Needs.
